These are PNNL versions of the FNAL repositories, where an HTG710FixedDMA fragment is assembled from the FELIX DMA'd data.
This is necessarily a sketch of instructions, and building/installing/running at your site will require some tweaking of 
everything below. Feel free to email eric.church@pnnl.gov for help.

The original code for artdaq-demo and artdaq-core-demo comes from https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/artdaq-demo/wiki. Start
by getting that code and building/installing:
git clone http://cdcvs.fnal.gov/projects/artdaq-demo
./artdaq-demo/tools/quick-mrb-start.sh 

The quick-mrb-start (sic) script pulls a whole bunch of products on which these two packages depend, builds and installs everything. 
There's nothing quick about it. Go get a sandwich and a cup of coffee. 

NOW we want to get the pnnl flavors of artdaq-demo and artdaq-core-demo. Do the following git-ology after the above has completed. 
Hop to your $BASEDIR/artdaq-demo directory and say 
git checkout -b feature/pnnl_artdaq_v1-13_03
git remote add origin-pnnl https://github.com/FELIXDAQ/artdaq-demo
git fetch origin-pnnl
git pull origin-pnnl feature/pnnl_artdaq-v2_00_00
Hop to your $BASEDIR/artdaq-core-demo directory and say 
git checkout -b feature/pnnl_artdaq-v2_00_00
git remote add origin-pnnl https://github.com/FELIXDAQ/artdaq-core-demo
git fetch origin-pnnl
git pull origin-pnnl feature/pnnl_artdaq_v1-13_03

These commands will merge the stuff from the PNNL repo on its feature/pnnl_artdaq-v1_13_03 branch into your source code. (After you make changes, you can then feel free to
commit and do git push origin-pnnl feature/pnnl_artdaq-v2_00_00 in the two separate repos.)

But now you have to go rebuild everything with the new PNNL code. This is involved, cuz we no longer hide the mysteries in quick-mrb-start.sh.
If you change the overlay classes in artdaq-core-demo you need to rebuild it, then rebuild artdaq-demo against that. And artdaq-demo changes have to be built, of course. If you don't
touch the overlay classes you only need to follow the artdaq-demo build instructions below. mrb takes care of all of this self-consistently. All this buildtool, mrb, ups stuff
is the FNAL WAY.

The feature/pnnl_artdaq-v1_13_03 version suddenly uses mrb to build, rather than "setup" of previous versions. This is a good thing. mrb knows how to build many repos at once. 
mrb == "multi repository build." So, after you've pulled your latest artdaq-demo and artdaq-core-demo changes and made sure you're on the branch feature/pnnl_artdaq-v1_13_03, 
hop to the top level $BASEDIR and say source setupARTDAQDEMO, then cd to your $BASEDIR/build area. Now say 
mrb z (basically, a rm -rf *) to clean your area of cruft. Now you will say mrbsetenv; mrb i -j8. 

This should cmake the Makefiles in both artdaq-demo and artdaq-core-demo; make those, then move code to your install area. Then, IMPORTANTLY, to run off these new, installed .so's 
make sure you say mrbslp. That sets all environment variables to use your newly built code.

(Hint; once you've properly done one mrbsetenv; mrb i such that all the cmake-ology is done, you only need to say "make -j8 install" subsequently, which speeds everything up.)
