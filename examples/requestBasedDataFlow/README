requestBasedDataFlow:

Demonstrates the Data Request capabilities of the CommandableFragmentGenerator
class. This example consists of a "DAQ" BoardReader reading out at a 
high rate, a "DCS" BoardReader which reads out very slowly,
but sends data for each event the "DAQ" BoardReader generates, and
a "CRV" BoardReader which samples uncorrelated data based
on the Fragment timestamps, providing the events that occurred within
a given time window around the "DAQ" events.
