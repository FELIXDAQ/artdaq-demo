triggeredReceiver Example:

Demonstrates the capabilities of the TriggeredFragmentGenerator 
class. This example consists of a "DAQ" BoardReader reading out at a 
high rate, a "DCS" TriggerdBoardReader which reads out very slowly,
but sends data for each event the "DAQ" BoardReader generates, and
a "CRV" TriggeredBoardReader which samples uncorrelated data based
on the Fragment timestamps.
